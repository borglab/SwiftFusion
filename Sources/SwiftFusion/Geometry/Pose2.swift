/// SE(2) Lie group of 2D Euclidean Poses.

/// We adopt the following conventions for the tangent space of this manifold and the derivatives
/// of functions to/from this manifold:
///
///   1. The tangent space at every point is R^3, interpreted as "twist coordinates", with the
///      first component specifying the rotation and the next two coordinates specifying the
///      translation.
///   2. For Lie groups `G`, `H`, with algebras `g`, `h`, the differential of any differentiable
///      function `f : G -> H` at `a \in G` is the linear map `df_a : g -> h` such that
///        f(a * exp(hat(eps))) ~= f(a) * exp(df_a(hat(eps)))
///      where:
///        `eps` is a "small" element of `R^3`, and
///        `hat` is the map from twist coordinates to se(2).
///      The pullback of `f` at `a` is the dual map of `df_a`.
///
/// These conventions match the conventions for SE(2) in [1] and [2], except that we use the
/// opposite order for the rotation and translation components.
///
/// (1) is accomplished by setting the `TangentVector` to `Vector3` and by defining the appropriate
/// exponential map in the `move(along:)` method.
///
/// (2) is accomplished for `Pose2` by defining differentials[3] satisfying (2) for three
//  functions:
///   - .t: SE(2) -> R^2
///   - .rot: SE(2) -> SO(2)
///   - init: R^2 x SO(2) -> SE(2)
/// Since these are the only functions exposed by the original `Pose2` declaration, all other
/// functions involving `Pose2` are forced to be compositions of these. Therefore, the derivatives
/// synthesized by Swift's automatic differentiation transform satisfy (2).

    //
    // We would like the differential of `init` at `(r, t)`, `dinit_(r, t)`, to satisfy:
    //   init(r * exp(hat(w)), t * exp(hat(v))) ~= init(r, t) * exp(hat(dinit_(r, t)(w, v)))
    // where `w`, `v` are "small" elements of R^1 and R^2 respectively.
    //
    // Using `t * exp(hat(v)) == t + v` simplifies the equation to:
    //   init(r * exp(hat(w)), t + v) ~= init(r, t) * exp(hat(dinit_(r, t)(w, v)))
    //
    // Multiplying on the left by `init(r, t)^-1 == init(r^t, r^t * (-t))` gives
    //   exp(hat(dinit_(r, t)(w, v)))
    //     = init(r^t, r^t * (-t)) * init(r * exp(hat(w)), t + v)
    //     = init(exp(hat(w)), r^t * v)
    //
    // Since `w`, `v` are small, we can take logs of both sides to get
    //   dinit_(t, r)(w, v) = (w, r^t * v)
    //
    // Or in matrix notation:
    //   dinit_(t, r)(w, v) =  ( 1    0 ) ( w )
    //                         ( 0  r^t ) ( v )
    //
    // We actually need the pullback rather than the differential, so that's the transpose:
    //   pbinit_(t, r)(w, v) =  ( 1 0 ) ( w )
    //                          ( 0 r ) ( v )
